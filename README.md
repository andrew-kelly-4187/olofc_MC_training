# MC Training
This repo contains training documents written for the senior altar servers at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Church, White City, to support their in-person training to become junior MC's.

The initial plan (subject to change) is as follows:
1. Have interactive Q&A markdown documents made using R covering the structure of the Mass, and the structure of the Missal (the main reason this is in a github repo!)
2. Have physical handouts ready for the in person session
3. Have physical "Prep Cards" laminated as quick reminders of what to look for
